### Completed Tasks:
- Investigated and troubleshot `react-to-print` integration for invoice printing.
- Reviewed and updated usage of `useReactToPrint` hook per latest official documentation.
- Adjusted `InvoicePrint` component usage with `useRef` to properly handle printing.
- Ensured the printable component is rendered off-screen but mounted in DOM.
- Tested the print trigger button to open the print dialog correctly.
- Decided to move away from `html2pdf.js` due to maintenance and functionality issues.
- Researched alternative PDF generation packages and considered future implementation plans.
- Updated error handling and UI feedback during print process.

### Notes:
- Printing with `react-to-print` requires the component to be mounted and accessible via ref.
- The print component should be visible in the DOM, even if offscreen, to ensure proper rendering.
- The `useReactToPrint` hook is the recommended modern method for triggering print functionality.
- Further work is planned on improving invoice styling for print and adding PDF export capabilities.
