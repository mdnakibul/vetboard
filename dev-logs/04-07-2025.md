🐾 VetBoard Dev Log -- July 4, 2025
==================================

✅ Completed Tasks
------------------

### 💊 Prescription Module Overhaul

- ✔️ Finalized updated `Prescription` and `Medicine` data types:
  - `Prescription` now supports `medicines: Medicine[]`, `notes`, and `nextReviewDate`
  - `Medicine` includes `medicineId`, `medicineName`, `dosage`, `frequency`, `duration`, and optional `notes`

- ✔️ Updated **prescription input UI** in `MedicalRecordForm`:
  - Replaced flat fields with multi-medicine form structure
  - Created `medicineInput` state with add/remove functionality
  - Each prescription can contain multiple medicines, notes, and a review date

### 🧾 Medical Record UI Adjustments

- ✔️ Updated the **Medical Record Card** to show all medicines under each prescription, along with notes and review dates
- ✔️ Created clear visual hierarchy for prescriptions under each medical record

### 👁️ Prescription Viewer Enhancements

- ✔️ Refactored the `ViewPrescription` modal:
  - Displays prescriptions as grouped medicine lists
  - Includes prescription-level notes and review dates

### ⚠️ Overdue Follow-up Detection

- ✔️ Planned and implemented `OverduePrescriptionBadge` component:
  - Accepts `patientId`, checks prescriptions for overdue `nextReviewDate`
  - Displays a warning badge if no appointment is scheduled after the due date
  - Clicking the badge opens a modal showing details of all overdue prescriptions
  - Designed for use in the **Patient List** table cell next to patient name

📌 Notes
--------

- Decided that `OverduePrescriptionBadge` should handle its own data fetching (medical records + appointments) internally for modularity
- Discussed potential future placement: patient list, medical record page, prescription modal
- Kept logic self-contained for performance and easier reuse

🕒 Total Time: ~4 hours
------------------------

- Focused deeply on the prescription feature revamp and alert system
- Refactored UI components and handled type/data structure migrations effectively
