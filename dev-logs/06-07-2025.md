🐾 VetBoard Dev Log — July 5-6, 2025
====================================

✅ Completed Tasks
------------------

### 💊 Prescription Module Refinement

- ✔ Updated `Prescription` and `Medicine` type definitions to support:
  - Multiple medicines per prescription
  - Optional `notes`
  - `nextReviewDate` for scheduling follow-ups

- ✔ Modified **prescription creation UI**:
  - Refactored input layout to handle nested medicines
  - Allowed adding/removing medicines dynamically
  - Added next review date field
  - Improved form UX for scrollable content and sticky buttons

- ✔ Updated **Medical Record card UI**:
  - Displayed prescriptions inline with visit, diagnosis, and treatment details
  - Rendered medicine info clearly with dosage, frequency, duration, and notes

- ✔ Enhanced **Prescription Viewer modal**:
  - Showed all prescriptions for a visit
  - Included each medicine with formatting
  - Added print button per prescription

- ✔ Built `PrescriptionPrintModal`:
  - Full prescription layout styled like a real veterinary sheet
  - Included hospital header, owner and animal info, medicine list, notes, and signature block
  - Print-friendly (with hidden UI sections via `@media print` CSS)

- ✔ Added logic to detect **overdue prescriptions**:
  - Compared `nextReviewDate` with current date
  - Cross-checked with patient’s appointment history
  - Displayed an "Overdue" badge if review is overdue and no follow-up appointment exists

- ✔ Created **OverdueBadge** component:
  - Accepts patient ID
  - Dynamically checks and renders the badge in UI (e.g., patient list)

### 🐞 Bug Fixes & Improvements

- ✔ Fixed incorrect `Array.prototype.some` usage in `getPrescriptionsById` function
- ✔ Resolved width issues in nested modal (`PrescriptionPrintModal`) with `max-w-[90vw]` + responsive Tailwind utilities
- ✔ Resolved accessibility warning from Radix:
  - Added `<DialogDescription>` to `DialogHeader` for better screen reader support

🕒 Total Time Spent: ~6–7 hours across 2 days
--------------------------------------------

📌 Notes
--------

- Prescription printing feature is now ready for real-world use.
- Further improvements (branding, watermark, vet signature) can be added to the print layout later.
- Consider enabling PDF export in addition to browser print for better file handling.
