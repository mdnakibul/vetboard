# 🐾 VetBoard Dev Log – June 28, 2025

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 🔍 Testing
- ✔ Tested **Patient Module** (add, edit, delete) with mock data
- ✔ Tested **Appointment Module** (add, edit, delete) and local storage
- ✔ All test cases passed for both modules

### 🔐 Authentication System
- ✔ Verified login and logout flows
- ✔ Protected routes redirect to `/login` when not logged in
- ✔ `localStorage.isLoggedIn` implemented for auth state

### 🚧 Routing Fixes
- ✔ Moved `404` page **outside protected layout**
- ✔ Now unauthenticated users see a clean 404 page with no sidebar
- ✔ "Go back to dashboard" button redirects to login when logged out

### 🧾 Tabbed Patient View Page
- ✔ Implemented using **ShadCN Tabs**
- ✔ Tabs added:
  - Basic Info
  - Medical History
  - Appointments
- ✔ Each tab includes "Add" button to create relevant entries
- ✔ Tab headers styled to span full width using `grid-cols-3`
