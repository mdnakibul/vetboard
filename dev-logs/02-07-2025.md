==================================

✅ Completed Tasks
------------------

### 💊 Prescription Module — Phase 1 (UI & Storage)

-   ✔ Designed and implemented a **Prescription section** inside the Medical Record creation/edit modal.
-   ✔ Enabled dynamic addition/removal of multiple prescription items with fields for medicine, dosage, frequency, duration, and notes.
-   ✔ Applied a scrollable modal layout with a **sticky submit button** to improve long-form usability.
-   ✔ Reorganized the modal layout using a `flex-col` + `overflow-y-auto` structure for smoother UX.

### 💾 Data Storage Enhancements

-   ✔ Updated `MedicalRecord` type to include embedded `prescriptions[]`.
-   ✔ Refactored `getStoredMedicalRecords()`, `saveMedicalRecord()`, `updateMedicalRecord()` functions to handle prescription data in localStorage.
-   ✔ Added optional utility to retrieve prescriptions by patient ID.

### 👁️ Prescription Viewer Integration

-   ✔ Built a reusable `PrescriptionViewer` modal component to display prescription details in a clean, styled layout.
-   ✔ Integrated **"View Prescription"** button in both:
    - 📋 Global Medical Records list
    - 🐶 Patient View → Medical History tab
-   ✔ Ensured modal shows prescription data conditionally, only when records contain prescriptions.

📦 Notes
--------

-   The PrescriptionViewer modal currently supports read-only viewing. Print/PDF export features to be added in next iteration.
-   Reusability of the component has been prioritized for consistency across views.
-   No major bugs encountered — modal scrolling and layout adjustments resolved earlier UI issues.

🕒 Total Time: ~2.5 hours
------------------------

-   Focused on feature design, UI/UX enhancements, and syncing form inputs with localStorage logic.
